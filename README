This is a test runner.
----------------------

The program runs tests on a given executable, comparing the expected stdout, stderr and exit code with
the results returned by the executable given specified arguments. 

--- Configuration ---
test_runner uses TOML files for defining test suites. For convenience "normal strings" can span over multiple lines. 
So no multi-strings like in the TOML Spec, just normal strings everywhere.
